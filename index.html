        <p>
          I was born and raised in New Jersey until moving to North Carolina
          several years ago. I am currently enrolled with Thinkful to become a
          software engineer. I am very determined to learn as much as possible
          to excel in this career path that I have chosen. I am excited to be
          able to work in an environment that has growth and opportunity to show
          my skills as well as to learn more that there is to know in this
          field. As a current Medical Biller for 10+ years, change isn't easy
          but I am loving every minute of it!
